# SEMO AUCTIONðŸ”º

This is a precompiled scrypt we are using for running our auction.
Based on [this auction article](https://xiaohuiliu.medium.com/auction-on-bitcoin-4ba2b6c18ba7), we made a slight modification to track the highest bidder by `Ripemd160` of the original bidder. Once a higher bid comes in, the refund will be automatically made to the original funder of the previous bid.

To see this auction working, please come check out auctions at [SEMO](https://www.semo3d.com)
